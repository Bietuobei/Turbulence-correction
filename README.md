# Turbulence-correction
This project is an implemention of compensate the vortex beams transmitted in atmospheric turbulence.
We used a image translation model, which is proposed by Taesung Park et al., to produce the corrected intensity distribution of the VB.
If you were interested in the CUT model, please check https://github.com/taesungp/contrastive-unpaired-translation. And if you use their code for your reasearch, please cite their paper.
